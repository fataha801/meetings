> __Purpose of this meeting:__ Help accomplish God’s work of salvation and exaltation in the ward. As we come unto Christ and help others do the same, we participate in God’s work of salvation and exaltation. This work is guided by the two great commandments to love God and to love our neighbors (see Matthew 22:37–39).
